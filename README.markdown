# "HandBreak It" is an advancede batch script for HandbrakeCLI

The goal behind this is not to replace Handbrake gui but to add a way to quickly and easily do a large batch encode of files based on saved presets. This is very much a work in progress.


The current beta now takes the preset as a flag, and will default to Apple > Universal as its default encoding preset.

## Currently there is a version 1.0;
* This version is CLI with a option sparse GUI for selecting folders and errors.
* It only uses the AppleTV 2 preset.
* This version is currently only for Mac OS X

Later versions will support a full gui, a strict CLI usage, and all presets.

## USAGE:
1. Install HandBrakeCLI from http://handbrake.fr/downloads2.php in to your /Applications Directory.
2. Run this script from the command line
3. Enjoy
