HandBreak It is a batch video encoder using Handbrake as it's engine.

The goal behind this is not to replace handbrake gui but to add a way to quickly and easily do a large batch encode of files based on saved presets.

Currently this only processes files for AppleTV 2 but can easily be changed to any preset or made ready for selecting presets.


This is very much a work in progress.

Currently there is a version 1.0;
    * This version is CLI with a option sparse GUI for selecting folders and errors.
    * It only uses the AppleTV 2 preset.

Later versions will support a full gui, a strict CLI usage, and all presets.
